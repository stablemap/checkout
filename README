This project is developed on JDK 8. To run the tests, execute

  ./gradlew test

This gradle wrapper should care of downloading dependencies.

The API is designed for integration with a user interface. At the most basic level one can price an
item by unit or weight, add or remove quantities of items to an order, and check on the value of an
order at any time:

  PricingPolicy pricingPolicy = new PricingPolicy();
  pricingPolicy.setPricePerUnit("cheese", 369);

  Order order = new Order(pricingPolicy);
  order.addUnit("cheese");
  log.info("Order subtotal is " + order.total());

Note that all prices are given in cents. More complex pricing is available -- an offer for 5 bricks
of cheese for $3 can be encoded as follows:

  pricingPolicy.setUnitSpecial("cheese", new BulkPricing(3, 500));

One can also limit the extent of a special by wrapping it appropriately:

  new LimitedSpecialPricing(new BulkPricing(3, 500), 6)

will cause the 7th brick purchased to cost the normal amount.
